title: A short synopsis of my journey towards data science

I fiddled with creating a blog a while back in graduate school but when work/research needed more and more of my time, that endeavor eventually fell by the wayside and forgotten. However, with the changes that have happened to me in the past year, I decided to start writing down my thoughts again. I am using this exercise as a metric I can use to assess my evolution while I make the transition from molecular biology research into a data science.

The career shift was not something I entered into lightly. A change of circumstance provided the catalyst that brought me to this field. Prior to pursuing a career in data science, I worked as a research scientist in a lab at the University of Washington.  The group I was a part of studied the genetic and metabolic underpinnings of aging. We managed to parlay our results into several impactful papers and also tried to carve out new research avenues along the way. Despite this apparent success however, additional funding did not follow and moneu eventually ran out for my project. I was laid off shortly thereafter.

As a lifelong learner, becoming a student again and explore something new (to me) was exciting. Initially, I focused on acquiring the fundamental tools that I would need (python, SQL, revisiting statistics) and when I felt I was ready, I enrolled in the Data Science Immersive boot camp at Galvanize. Those twelve weeks flew by fast and before I knew it, I was doing a presentation of my final project and graduated the next day. Of course, that was only the beginning. This field is so complex and expansive that there is always something else to master. So, while I try to find my first role in data science, I also continue to take on new challenges, adding more knowledge base by taking online courses, and crafting new data science projects. The best part of it is that I can say with certainty that I do enjoy the work and the challenges. I am ready for more.
