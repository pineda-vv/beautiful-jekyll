Victor Pineda, Ph.D.

- I am a data scientist looking for an opportunity to contribute to a great team.
- I was trained in pharmacology, neuroscience, molecular biology, and genetics. I spent a good chunk of my working life as a research scientist trying to glean insights and understanding in the fields of neurodegenerative disease, learning and memory, and organismal aging.


In my spare time

- Enjoying the outdoor offerings of the Pacific Northwest - hiking, cycling, snowboarding, among other things.
- Building up my data science chops by continually learning - crafting new D.S. projects, learning new skills, techniques, algorithms, and being a part of the python and machine learning community in Seattle through meetups and networking.
