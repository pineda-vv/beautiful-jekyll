*My Background*

- I am a data scientist looking for an opportunity to contribute to a great team.
- I was trained in pharmacology, neuroscience, molecular biology, and genetics. I spent a good chunk of my working life as a research scientist gleaning insights and understanding of molecular and genetic processes involved in neurodegenerative disease progression, long-term memory formation, and in organismal aging.


*In my spare time*

- I enjoy the outdoor offerings of the Pacific Northwest - hiking, cycling, snowboarding, camping.
- A lifelong learner, I continue to add to my data science portfolio and skillset - crafting new D.S. projects, reading about techniques and algorithms, and interacting with the python and machine learning community in Seattle through meetups and networking.
