title: Who am I

### **My Background**

* I am a data scientist currently looking for an opportunity to contribute my data science skills to a great team. My journey to this career transition is further discussed in my blog.
* I worked previously as a scientist with expertise in pharmacology, neuroscience, molecular biology, and genetics. I spent a good chunk of my working life in basic science research trying to understand the molecular and genetic processes involved in neurodegenerative disease pathology, long-term memory formation, and the genetics and metabolic underpinnings of aging. I have published a number of papers in these subjects both as the primary author and as collaborator. I have also served as a mentor for a number of graduate and undergraduate students pursuing their own research interests.


### **In my spare time**

* Living in the Pacific Northwest Rocks! - I take every opportunity to enjoy the outdoors by hiking, cycling, and camping in the summer. Several winter play areas are within driving distance for skiing/snowboarding, snowshoeing, and sledding.
* A lifelong learner, I continue to fortify my data science skillset and solidify my understanding of the field - crafting new data science projects, delving further into understanding techniques and algorithms that I have used, and interacting with the python and machine learning community in Seattle through meetups and networking.
